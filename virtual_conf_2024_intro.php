                                <p><b>Distinguish Colleagues,</b></p>
                                <p>I warmly welcome you to the maiden annual ASFI Virtual Multidisciplinary Conference and Boot Camp. This conference and bootcamp camp, coming in the third year of the existence of ASFI, marks an important milestone for the growth of the organization and science in our dear continent. It is exciting to see that we can altogether make this event a reality.</p>
                                <p>Our dear continent, Africa, faces numerous developmental challenges. The role of science in providing innovative evidence to spur societal development is at no other time in our developmental evolvement more critically needed than now. But our efforts cannot yield any positive result when we work in isolation. Our numerous societal challenges always carry multiple faces. It is on this note that the old ship’s crew saying, “all hands must be on deck”, comes alive. We can only make tangible impacts when we all come together, regardless of disciplines, nationalities, and other affiliations to discuss and propose solutions for our dear continent.</p>
                                <p>The need for a multi-sectoral approach in solving Africa’s developmental challenges through research was the motivating reason for this conference and boot camp, which is planned to hold annually. Consequently, the event has been rightly tagged as a multidisciplinary event, focusing on the theme: “Research for Africa’s Transformation: Challenges, Quality and Impact.” I believe that this conference and boot camp creates a forum for self-expression, unity of purpose, and innovative conversations on how our collective research can become a prominent ingredient in Africa’s developmental agenda. With this onerous focus, coupling together our diverse research orientations and disciplines, we can together achieve more than otherwise. For this, I boldly say that there is hope for Africa’s science as a panacea for Africa’s development.</p>
                                <p>The planning for this event started just over eight months ago. The planning committees were set up, comprising both those experienced in organizing an event of this kind and those with no experience. The overarching goal of this mixed bag was to enable capacity building, mentoring, and experience sharing, at the same time make concrete progress in planning the event. Dr. Verrah Otiende (Chair, conference planning committee) and Dr. Eunice Fonyuy Fondze-Fombele (chair, boot camp planning committee) mobilized their committee members, made uncountable sacrifices and sterling efforts to pull together this robust program for this event. They have indeed set an excellent template that we can capitalize on for the future. Without them, this event would have been impossible. To them all thanks go to!</p>
                                <p>Once more, I welcome you to this maiden annual multidisciplinary event. I enjoin you to take the opportunities it offers. Bring on your abstracts – whether oral or posters, whether completed or work-in-progress, and regardless of your career stage. It is a place for everyone. It is a place to learn. It is a place to impart knowledge and skills. It is a place for all Africans!</p>

                                <p><b>Distinguish Colleagues,</b></p>
                                <p>I have the pleasure to welcome you to this maiden edition of the ASFI Annual Virtual Multidisciplinary Conference and Boot Camp. I particularly welcome you to this multidisciplinary scientific engagement in my capacity as the Chair of the Boot Camp Planning Committee, doubling as the pioneer President of the ASFI Members’ General Assembly. In these capacities and counting on my ardent followership of ASFI programs over the last 3 years, I can confidently confess that without continuous research capacity building, Africa’s place in global research reckoning and research-oriented development will remain only a dream. This is the motivation for the Boot Camp</p>
                                <p>The research innovation eco-system necessitates cultivating adaptability and continuous improvement in how relevance, quality and impact of research is imagined and produced. Also, scientific research, technology application and transfer, communication of research results, translation of output for uptake and capturing of impact are foundational to better address the need for meaningful real-world change and to achieve Africa’s developmental goals. However, Africa faces several constraints in relation to the research process, impact, communication and translation of research results to end users. For example, one of the challenges to socio-cultural, economic, political, ecological/environmental and technological advancement in Africa is the limited use of research results for decision-making. Given the dynamic and complex developmental situation Africa faces and the depth and urgency of these challenges, it requires more than just researchers with conventional research skills. Capacity building through anticipatory, active and discerning activities and skills that aid in aligning impact with the desired real world meaningful and transformational change are needed. </p>
                                <p>The ASFI 2023 Virtual Science Boot Camp is a crucible for African scientists at different career levels, fields and expertise who aim to generate desirable change through smart self-training activities. They are researchers who acknowledge context and complexity of problems that require multidisciplinary and collaborative approaches to address, as they promote quality, relevance, impact and meaningful transformation through well-thought-out activities. The end result is to camp and find synergies, share ideas between and across disciplines and discuss issues of key interest in the valorization of research results and products in the developmental process of the African continent. </p>
                                <p>The benefits are idea-sharing, development of ‘soft’ and technical skills, development of strong peer groups, discovering and expansion of networks, building of collaborative projects, sourcing for new opportunities, promoting and celebrating excellence.</p>
