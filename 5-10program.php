                        <div class="text">
                            <p>The ASFI 5-10 Program 2026 is a research capacity building program targeting African universities. ASFI's core mandate is to support the development of excellent science community in Africa. Since its inception, ASFI has primarily supported individual African researchers. The ASFI 5-10 Program targets institutions as entities rather than individual researchers. The program will create impact at the institutional level.</p>

                        <div class="text">
                            <p>The overarching aim of the program is to create clusters of next generation research champions across African universities. ASFI will train and mentor 250 candidates across Africa's five regions (50 candidates from 10 institutions in each region) during 2026 in research excellence, integrity, and science patriotism, with expected milestones to be achieved during the program. Candidates will form clusters of inter-regional and inter-institutional multidisciplinary collaborations to achieve set milestones during the program. Candidates who complete the program will receive "ASFI CONSOLIDATED RESEARCH EXCELLENCE CAPACITY BUILDING CERTIFICATE" at the end of the program. Beneficiaries are expected to give back acquired skills and experiences to their university communities.</p>
