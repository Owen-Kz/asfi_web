                            ASFI was established in 2020. Like many other online-based initiatives, the COVID-19 pandemic was an important drive to exert more effort to deliver our message. <br>
                            During the past three years of its existence, ASFI has made encouraging milestones, surpassing the targets we set at the outset. 
                            Through our hands-on courses, seminars and workshops, and mentoring activities, we reached researchers in over 40 African countries. 
                             <br>
                            These contacts have brought African scientists and researchers, young and old, to work together, network, collaborate towards a common goal – that is, make the voices of scientists heard and counted in the developmental agenda of the continent. 
                             <br>
                            The following infographics highlights the key milestones we achieved during the first three years (2020-2022) of ASFI’s existence.
